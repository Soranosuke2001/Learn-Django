## Course Resources

All materials needed for the course is found in the Course_Resources folder

## Django and Bootstrap Versions

Notes are based on Bootstrap 3 and Django 1.11. Apparently there aren't any significant changes to the course resources, but the recommended versions are to be used.

Note: The `Course_Resources_2` folder contains the files for the updated Django version.

Bootstrap Docs: [Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/)

In order to use Django 1.11, when pip installing the package, use the following command:

```bash
pip install django==1.11
```

This will ensure that Django 1.11 is installed and not the latest version.
